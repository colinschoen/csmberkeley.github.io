## Mentorship

We have unfortunately closed applications for Senior and Junior Mentors. We will be opening applications once again for the Fall 2015 semester for Senior Mentors in April 2015, and Junior Mentors in August 2015. Check back then!

## Tutoring

Are you a student looking for more help? Email us at [csmberkeley@gmail.com](mailto:csmberkeley@gmail.com) if you are interested in enrolling in an adjunct section. We still have spots available for CS 61A. Check Piazza for weekly offerings of one-on-one tutoring for respective classes.
