<h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Computer Science Mentors is a community built around teaching Computer Science at UC Berkeley. We support aspiring educators by providing mentoring and teaching opportunities to students in introductory computer science courses. In addition, these mentors provide opportunities to students who need further academic support. Through this framework, we are able to both encourage educators and support learners of computer science.</p>


<h1>History</h1>
    <p>August 2014 marked the influx of students interested in Computer Science. In the beginning of the fall, nearly 2,000 students enrolled in the two introductory computer science courses at UC Berkeley: CS 61A and CS 61B. In a challenging field such as this one, it is easy to feel lost in such an environment.</p>

    <p>A group of undergraduates who were tutoring at the time, frequently saw students struggling and feeling lost. As a group, these students collectively could only support ~70 students at a time, when in reality there were so many more students who needed much more support than this group could provide. In November, they decided to change this.</p>

    <p>This Spring, 2,400 students will be enrolled in CS 61A and CS 61B. Instead of 70 students, this group will now be able to support 300+. This is Computer Science Mentors.</p>

    <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>With over 1,000 students enrolled in each of the introductory computer science courses, it's easy to lose oneself in such a large environment. We offer students the opportunity to learn and teachers the opportunity to teach through adjunct sections and one-on-one tutoring methods.</p>

    <h2>Mentorship</h2>
        <p>Through a mentorship system, we provide opportunities for budding teachers (called "Junior Mentors") to both teach Computer Science with a group of ~5 students each and learn from experienced teachers (called "Senior Mentors"). Senior Mentors have opportunities to write material and provide tips to Junior Mentors on how to teach, in addition to teaching a section of their own.</p>

    <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>We bring computer science educators together through collective tutoring and social events!</p>
