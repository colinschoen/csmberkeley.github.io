    <div class="join-box">
      <h2 id="mentor-faq">FAQ</h2>
        <div class="question">What are you looking for in a Junior Mentor?</div>
        <div class="answer">We look for applicants who are dedicated to their students. This could be in the form of previous tutoring experience, mastery of the material, and flexible time commitments. While we do take grades into account, it is not a prioritized metric. Many successful mentors have received a variety of grades.</div>

        <div class="question">Are there any prerequisites to be a Junior Mentor?</div>
        <div class="answer">There are no formal requirements, but we prefer mentors to have had at least one semester of lab assisting, either in past semesters or concurrently.</div>

        <div class="question">What is the time commitment for a Junior Mentor?</div>
        <div class="answer">We estimate 3-4 hours/week. We break it down as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>Senior Mentor meeting: 1 hour</li>
            <li>Tutoring meeting: 1 hour</li>
            <li>Other preparation: 1-2 hours</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">How many Junior Mentors are you planning on accepting?</div>
        <div class="answer">Depends on the class and the budget associated with each one. In general, our mentors will be in total ~7% of the overall class size (which includes Senior Mentors, Junior Mentors, and Associate Mentors). This semester, we are looking for 10-30 Junior Mentors.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I be a junior mentor without meeting with a senior mentor?</div>
        <div class="answer">You may. We have another category of mentor called “Associate Mentor” in which you have extensive experience in the class you’re mentoring for. We will be more strict with acceptances as an Associate Mentor and generally encourage first time tutors to be a Junior Mentor and receive guidance from Senior Mentors.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I get units for being a mentor?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes! Each Junior Mentor can receive 1 unit of P/NP credit. We will provide you the appropriate CCN when the time comes. You are not required to enroll.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I also do other forms of tutoring other than group?</div>
        <div class="answer">Junior Mentors’ primary responsibility is to host group tutoring. However, Junior Mentors may also choose to do 1-1 tutoring in conjunction with CS 98, Introduction to Teaching Computer Science. For other forms of support, you are free to lab assist or assist in office hours or guerrilla sections, provided you have received a passing grade in your respective class.</div>

        <div class="question">What is this CS 370 I keep hearing about?</div>
        <div class="answer">CS 370, or CS 98, Introduction to Teaching Computer Science, is a class for aspiring teachers, providing guidance to lab assistants on how to teach computer science and put it into practice. It offers 1-1 tutoring for the class of your choice. Many of our mentors have taken this class concurrently or previously, and is highly recommended! More information on the <a href="http://berkeley-cs370.github.io/">CS 370 website</a>.</div>

        <div class="question">Who can I contact if I have more questions?</div>
        <div class="answer">Feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:csmberkeley@gmail.com">csmberkeley@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions or concerns!</div>
