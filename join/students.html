*Support
Group Tutoring
CSM offers group tutoring to all students in the two introductory classes. Each student will be sorted into one of the timeslots of his or her preference. Each session will be held weekly in either Soda or Cory for one hour from 10-6pm. Mentors will go over a worksheet in section with extra problems to be worked on in groups. Homework, lab, and project help will not be provided during these sessions.
One-on-One Tutoring
We work in conjunction with CS370. Sign-ups are on a weekly first-come-first serve basis. Homework, lab, and project help will not be provided during these sessions. Check out your respective Piazza to sign up.

*Expectations
Students enrolled in group tutoring are eligible for one unit of P/NP credit. Grades are based on attendance. Those attending the session for a grade are required to attend 90% of weekly assigned sessions.

*Application Process
Check out our portal to sign up. There will be two waves of applications. Please be patient while we sort out 200+ students into sections.

*FAQ
The deadline to sign up has already passed, can I still sign up?
Yes. CSM's biggest priority is reaching out to as many students as we can. However, if you aren't enrolled on Telebears, you will still be required to regularly attend the specific section you are assigned to.
Can I switch to another time slot if I can’t make the one I’m assigned to?
You can switch to another section as a last resort! You'll have to give us all your available times, because it will depend on what sections have openings.
Can I get units for attending a section?
Yes! Each student can receive 1 unit of P/NP credit. We will provide you the appropriate CCN when the time comes. You are not required to enroll. You must attend 90% of assigned weekly sessions in order to pass.
Who can I contact if I have more questions?
Feel free to email us at EMAIL@csm.berkeley.edu if you have any questions or concerns! -->
